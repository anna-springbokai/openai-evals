  description:  "This evaluation provides a few examples of primary outcomes (main variable in clinical trials)
                and assesses the performance of GPT models on the primary outcome extraction task.
  
                Outcomes (endpoints) are variables monitored during clinical trials to assess the impact
                of the intervention studied on the health of study subjects. Automatic extraction of trial outcomes
                is a common task in Biomedical NLP. Automatic extraction of trial outcomes
                is essential for automating systematic review process, enabling medical question answering,
                and for checking the completeness and coherence of reporting to avoid bias and spin.

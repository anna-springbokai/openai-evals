  description: "Outcomes (endpoints) are variables monitored during clinical trials to assess the impact
                of the intervention studied on the health of study subjects.
                Significance level is calculated for each outcome to assess whether the intervention is beneficial. 
                Outcomes are often misreported in scientific articles,
                e.g. non-significant outcomes are omitted,
                new outcomes (the ones that were not pre-defined) are added if they are significant,
                outcomes are claimed to improve but numerical results and significance levels are not presented.
                Misreporting of trial outcomes has harmful effects as it can create misleading impression
                about the effectiveness or safety of the intervention.
                Correct reporting is particularly important for primary outcomes  - main variables assessed in a clinical trial.
                This evaluation provides a few examples of abstracts with correcy and incorrect reporting of primary outcomes
                and assesses the performance of GPT models on the task of detecting incorrect/imcomplete reporting of outcomes.
